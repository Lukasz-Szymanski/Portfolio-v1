# Learning: Authentic Content Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-22
**Status:** Implemented
**Context:** Phase 8 - Final Polish

## 1. Context & Problem
Initially, the portfolio used generic titles like "System Engineer" and "Junior Backend Developer". While technically accurate for the role sought, it felt inauthentic for a self-taught developer looking for their first role. It also failed to leverage the unique background of the candidate (Music & Video Composition).

## 2. Decision: Authenticity Over Titles
We decided to pivot the narrative from "claiming titles" to "showing potential".

*   **Hero Section:** Changed "Junior Engineer" to **"Aspiring Backend Developer"**. This shows humility and self-awareness, highly valued traits in juniors.
*   **Storytelling:** In the `About` section, we explicitly connected the dots:
    *   Start: Frontend (Visuals).
    *   Evolution: Curiosity about "what's under the hood".
    *   Current: Backend & Architecture.
*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** We highlighted the background in **Music Composition & Video Editing**.
    *   Music -> Structure, Harmony (Architecture).
    *   Video -> Detail-oriented, Editing (Clean Code).

## 3. Implementation Details
*   **Hobbies:** Moved away from generic "Tech" tags to specific "Film Scoring" and "Video Editing".
*   **Contact:** Added GitLab to show familiarity with DevOps tools, not just GitHub.
*   **Legal:** Added a minimalist Footer with a privacy disclaimer suitable for a demo project (GDPR-light).

## 4. Key Takeaways
*   **Be Human:** Recruiters hire people, not just git repositories. Showing passion (even outside IT) makes the candidate memorable.
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying "I am an expert", we say "Here is my code, judge for yourself".
