# Project Spotlight: Git-Sensei CLI (AI DevOps Tooling)

## Status
External Project (Featured in Portfolio)

## About the Project
Git-Sensei is a "Meta-CLI" tool designed to solve a universal developer problem: "Commit Fatigue." It automates the generation of meaningful, high-quality git commit messages by analyzing code changes.

## Why this project is in the Portfolio
It demonstrates advanced Python engineering skills beyond standard web applications:
1.  **CLI Automation:** Building complex terminal-based tools using Python.
2.  **AI Prompt Engineering:** Designing specialized prompts that analyze raw `git diff` outputs to extract developer intent and code semantics.
3.  **Multi-Provider Integration:** Supports various LLM backends, including Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and local models via Ollama (Privacy-First).
4.  **DevOps Mindset:** A tool built to improve team culture by enforcing high-standard Git logs and documentation.

## Technical Challenges
- **Diff Parsing:** Processing raw git output into a structured, AI-readable context window.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Implementing local LLM support for corporate environments with sensitive code.
- **Configurability:** Developing a flexible configuration system using `.sensei.toml`.
